## 15. NEGATIVE PATHS / SECURITY CHECKS

| Action | Expected |
|---|---|
| GET `/api/properties` without token | 401 |
| GET `/api/admin/stats` as landlord | 403 |
| POST `/api/announcements` scope=global as landlord | 403 |
| POST forum thread in another landlord's property | 403 |
| PATCH another seller's yard sale listing | 403 |
| Sign another tenant's lease | 403 |

| Direct URL `/admin` as non-admin role | redirect to `/dashboard` |

---

## 16. DEMO MODE / MOCKED BEHAVIOURS (KNOWN)

- 💳 **M-Pesa STK Push** runs in DEMO mode — no real money. Auto-confirms after ~4 seconds via the simulated callback in `mpesa.py::schedule_demo_callback`. Receipts are prefixed `DEMO...`. Replace with real Daraja credentials in `/app/backend/.env` to switch to live.
- 🤖 **AI Match** falls back to "cheapest 3 matching" if `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY` is missing/errored. The `used_llm` flag in the response tells you whether Claude Sonnet 4.5 was used.
- 🔔 **Notifications** poll every 30 seconds (no websockets yet).
- 📷 **Image uploads** are saved to local disk under `/app/backend/uploads/...` and served via `/api/uploads/...`.

---

## 17. AUTOMATED COVERAGE

The same flows are covered by pytest:

- `/app/backend/tests/test_phase1_properties.py` — 19 tests (Phase 1)
- `/app/backend/tests/test_phase234.py` — 30 tests (Phase 2/3/4)

Run all:
```bash
cd /app && pytest backend/tests/ -v
```

Expected: **49/49 passing**.
